A comprehensive Python 3 API wrapper for Garmin Connect, providing access to health, fitness, and device data.

## 📖 About

This library enables developers to programmatically access Garmin Connect data including:

- **Health Metrics**: Heart rate, sleep, stress, body composition, SpO2, HRV
- **Activity Data**: Workouts, exercises, training status, performance metrics  
- **Device Information**: Connected devices, settings, alarms, solar data
- **Goals & Achievements**: Personal records, badges, challenges, race predictions
- **Historical Data**: Trends, progress tracking, date range queries

Compatible with all Garmin Connect accounts. See <https://connect.garmin.com/>

## 📦 Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip3 install garminconnect
```

## 🔐 Authentication

The library uses the same OAuth authentication as the official Garmin Connect app via [Garth](https://github.com/matin/garth).

**Key Features:**
- Login credentials valid for one year (no repeated logins)
- Secure OAuth token storage 
- Same authentication flow as official app

**Advanced Configuration:**
```python
# Optional: Custom OAuth consumer (before login)
import garth
garth.sso.OAUTH_CONSUMER = {'key': 'your_key', 'secret': 'your_secret'}
```

**Token Storage:**
Tokens are automatically saved to `~/.garminconnect` directory for persistent authentication.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Set token directory (uses example.py credentials)
export GARMINTOKENS=~/.garminconnect

# Install development dependencies
pdm install --group :all
```

**Run Tests:**
```bash
pdm run test        # Run all tests
pdm run testcov     # Run tests with coverage report
```

**Note:** Test files use credential tokens created by `example.py`, so run the example script first to generate authentication tokens.

## 🛠️ Development

Set up a development environment for contributing:

> **Note**: This project uses [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/) for modern Python dependency management and task automation. All development tasks are configured as PDM scripts in `pyproject.toml`.

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Install PDM (Python Dependency Manager)
pip install pdm

# Install all development dependencies
pdm install --group :all

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional)
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

**Available Development Commands:**
```bash
pdm run format     # Auto-format code (isort, black, ruff --fix)
pdm run lint       # Check code quality (isort, ruff, black, mypy)
pdm run codespell  # Check spelling errors in code and comments
pdm run test       # Run test suite
pdm run testcov    # Run tests with coverage report
pdm run all        # Run full quality checks (lint + codespell + test)
pdm run clean      # Clean build artifacts and cache files
pdm run build      # Build package for distribution
pdm run publish    # Build and publish to PyPI
```

**View all available commands:**
```bash
pdm run --list     # Display all available PDM scripts
```

**Code Quality Workflow:**
```bash
# Before making changes
pdm run lint       # Check current code quality

# After making changes  
pdm run format     # Auto-format your code
pdm run lint       # Verify code quality
pdm run codespell  # Check spelling
pdm run test       # Run tests to ensure nothing broke
```

Run these commands before submitting PRs to ensure code quality standards.
