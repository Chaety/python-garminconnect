A comprehensive Python 3 API wrapper for Garmin Connect, providing access to health, fitness, and device data.

## 📖 About

This library enables developers to programmatically access Garmin Connect data including:

- **Health Metrics**: Heart rate, sleep, stress, body composition, SpO2, HRV
- **Activity Data**: Workouts, exercises, training status, performance metrics  
- **Device Information**: Connected devices, settings, alarms, solar data
- **Goals & Achievements**: Personal records, badges, challenges, race predictions
- **Historical Data**: Trends, progress tracking, date range queries

Compatible with all Garmin Connect accounts. See <https://connect.garmin.com/>

## 📦 Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip3 install garminconnect
```

## 🔐 Authentication

The library uses the same OAuth authentication as the official Garmin Connect app via [Garth](https://github.com/matin/garth).

**Key Features:**
- Login credentials valid for one year (no repeated logins)
- Secure OAuth token storage 
- Same authentication flow as official app

**Advanced Configuration:**
```python
# Optional: Custom OAuth consumer (before login)
import garth
garth.sso.OAUTH_CONSUMER = {'key': 'your_key', 'secret': 'your_secret'}
```

**Token Storage:**
Tokens are automatically saved to `~/.garminconnect` directory for persistent authentication.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Set token directory (uses example.py credentials)
export GARMINTOKENS=~/.garminconnect

# Install pytest (if needed)
sudo apt install python3-pytest
```

**Run Tests:**
```bash
make install-test
make test
```

**Note:** Test files use credential tokens created by `example.py`, so run the example script first to generate authentication tokens.

## 🛠️ Development

Set up a development environment for contributing:

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
make .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip3 install pdm ruff
pdm init
```

**Development Tools:**
```bash
# Install code quality tools
sudo apt install pre-commit isort black mypy
pip3 install pre-commit
```

**Code Quality Checks:**
```bash
make format    # Format code
make lint      # Lint code  
make codespell # Check spelling
```

Run these commands before submitting PRs to ensure code quality standards.

## 📦 Publishing

For package maintainers:

**Setup PyPI credentials:**
```bash
sudo apt install twine
vi ~/.pypirc
```
```ini
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = <PyPI_API_TOKEN>
```

**Publish new version:**
```bash
make publish
```
